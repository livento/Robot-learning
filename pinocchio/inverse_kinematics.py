"""Example of differential IK stuck in a local minimum.

We set up a simple pendulum with joint limits (0, 2 * pi) radians. That is,
joint angles have to be positive, but the joint can do a full turn. We then
define the goal configuration with an angle of 5.5 rad, and initialize the
robot at joint angle 0.5 rad. We task the pendulum with moving its tip to the
tip-position of the goal configuration.

Because differential IK is a local (think "greedy") algorithm, it will move the
tip on the shortest path to target by turning the pendulum clockwise. This will
locally improve the task error, but eventually the pendulum will just get stuck
at its configuration limit (joint angle = 0 rad). At this stage, differential
IK will just keep pushing against the constraint, which is locally the least
worst thing to do.

The global solution would be to accept a temporary increase in the "current tip
to goal tip" distance, and make the pendulum turn anti-clockwise.
